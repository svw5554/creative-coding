                <p>The United States has a lot to offer travelers willing to spend the time exploring it. There are stunning national parks, gorgeous landscapes, incredible and diverse culture, world-class music, and a variety of delicious food that varies from region to region. It is one of the best destinations in the world to road trip. While the coastal cities are fun, the U.S. really reveals itself in the middle and countryside (it’s much more affordable there too). It’s in the nooks and crannies of America that you get a sense of its quirks.</p>
